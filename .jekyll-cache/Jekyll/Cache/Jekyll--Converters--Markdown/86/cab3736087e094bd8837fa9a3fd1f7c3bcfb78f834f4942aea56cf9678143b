I"Ç<h1>IGRINS</h1>
<p>Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph which can cover the entire wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45Î¼m in a single exposure with a resolving power of R~45,000.
IGRINS was built in a partnership between the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> and the <a href="https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index">Korea Astronomy and Space-Science Institute (KASI)</a> with the expectation that it would be deployed to multiple facilities.
Since commissioning in July 2014, IGRINS has been scheduled for more that 1000 nights on the <a href="https://mcdonald.utexas.edu/">2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory</a>, the <a href="https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/">4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (now the Lowell Discovery Telescope) at Lowell Observatory</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/">8.1m Gemini South telescope</a>.
IGRINS is a prototype for the <a href="https://www.gmt.iag.usp.br/en/projects/gmtnirs">GMTNIRS instrument</a>.</p>
