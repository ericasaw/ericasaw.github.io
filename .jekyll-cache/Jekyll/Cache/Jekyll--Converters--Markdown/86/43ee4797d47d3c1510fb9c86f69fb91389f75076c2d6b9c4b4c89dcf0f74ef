I"P	<h1>Raw IGRINS Files</h1>
<p>The Raw component of RRISA includes all of the frames IGRINS has ever observed before May 2021 including Flats, Darks, Arcs, Targets, and Standards.
This includes images that are not suitable for science like partial frames, frames with incorrect exposure times, or mislabeled frames.
RRISA includes all of the night logs and paper logs for all of the IGRINS observations.
We highly recommend that users of the Raw component consult the paper logs for any observations pre-Gemini South to confirm all of the frames for any particular target are suitable for science before reducing a target spectra.</p>

<p>Downloadable from <a href="https://github.com/IGRINScontact/RRISA.git">our GitHub</a> as a .csv or .xls or see the spreadsheet embedded below for quick ctr+f/cmd+f searching.</p>

<h3>IGRINS Observations</h3>
<p>Raw data from IGRINS includes the ‘SDCS’ slit-viewer images, ‘SDCH’ two-dimensional H-band echellogram, and ‘SDCK’ two-dimensional K-band echellogram.
IGRINS simultaneously observes the H and K spectra, and file numbers match for the two bands.
Slit-viewer images are generally saved during target acquisition and guiding.
An on chip image example of the IGRINS H and K band spectra can be seen below.</p>

<p>The IGRINS slit dimensions (width x length) in arcseconds are 0.34x5 at Gemini South, 0.63x9.3 at Lowell’s Discovery Telescope, and 1x15 at McDonald Observatory.
Point sources (anything with a seeing limited image on the slit-viewer) are generally observed in two positions on the slit.
The two positions, A and B, are separated by half a slit length.</p>
