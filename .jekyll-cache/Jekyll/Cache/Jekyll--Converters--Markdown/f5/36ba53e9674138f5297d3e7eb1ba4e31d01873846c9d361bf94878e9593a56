I"T<h1>Reduced Data Products</h1>
<p>All of the existing IGRINS data has been hand reduced using the <a href="https://github.com/igrins/plp">(IGRINS plp)</a>.
The Reduced version of RRISA includes different names for targets than the Raw component.
These are names that have been painstakingly corrected by manually searching through the IGRINS paper logs for handwritten coordinates and names, through SIMBAD for nomenclature corrections and coordinate offsets.
Targets that are subcomponents of systems or extended sources keep their identifier, and if not SIMBAD searchable, do not have any additional information added in the XMatch version of RRISA.</p>

<p>Downloadable from <a href="https://github.com/IGRINScontact/RRISA.git">our github</a> as a .csv or .xls or see the spreadsheet embedded below.</p>
