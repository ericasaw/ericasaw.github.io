<h3>IGRINS Observations</h3>
<p>Raw data from IGRINS includes the ‘SDCS’ slit-viewer images, ‘SDCH’ two-dimensional H-band echellogram, and ‘SDCK’ two-dimensional K-band echellogram.
IGRINS simultaneously observes the H and K spectra, and file numbers match for the two bands.
Slit-viewer images are generally saved during target acquisition and guiding.</p>

    <figcaption>Distribution of IGRINS observations (including A0V standards) up to May 2021 that are cross matched in SIMBAD plotted in galactic coordinates. The color gradient represents density of unique observations: areas of space where IGRINS has more unique observations are lightest, while darker teal areas have fewer unique observations. The dense region on the lower left of the plot is Taurus, the center dense region is a mix of both Ophiuchus &amp; Upper Scorpius, and the dense region on the lower right is Orion star forming region.</figcaption>

<p>The IGRINS slit dimensions (width x length) in arcseconds are 0.34x5 at Gemini South, 0.63x9.3 at Lowell’s Discovery Telescope, and 1x15 at McDonald Observatory.
Point sources (anything with a seeing limited image on the slit-viewer) are generally observed in two positions on the slit.
The two positions, A and B, are separated by half a slit length.</p>
