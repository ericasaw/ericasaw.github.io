<h3>IGRINS Observations</h3>
<p>Raw data from IGRINS includes the â€˜SDCSâ€™ slit-viewer images, â€˜SDCHâ€™ two-dimensional H-band echellogram, and â€˜SDCKâ€™ two-dimensional K-band echellogram.
IGRINS simultaneously observes the H and K spectra, and file numbers match for the two bands.
Slit-viewer images are generally saved during target acquisition and guiding.</p>

<p>The IGRINS slit dimensions (width x length) in arcseconds are 0.34x5 at Gemini South, 0.63x9.3 at Lowellâ€™s Discovery Telescope, and 1x15 at McDonald Observatory.
Point sources (anything with a seeing limited image on the slit-viewer) are generally observed in two positions on the slit.
The two positions, A and B, are separated by half a slit length.</p>
