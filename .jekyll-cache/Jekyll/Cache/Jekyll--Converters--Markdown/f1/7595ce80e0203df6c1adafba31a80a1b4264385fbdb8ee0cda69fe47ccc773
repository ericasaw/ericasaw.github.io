I"³<h1>IGRINS</h1>
<p>Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph which can cover the entire wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45Î¼m in a single exposure with a resolving power of R~45,000.
Since commissioning in July 2014, IGRINS has been scheduled for more that 1000 nights on the <a href="https://mcdonald.utexas.edu/">2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory</a>, the <a href="https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/">4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (now the Lowell Discovery Telescope) at Lowell Observatory</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/">8.1m Gemini South telescope</a>.</p>
