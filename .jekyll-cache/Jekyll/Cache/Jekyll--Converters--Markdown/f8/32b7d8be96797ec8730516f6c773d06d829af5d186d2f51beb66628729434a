<p>
Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph which can cover the entire wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45Î¼m in a single exposure with a resolving power of R~45,000.
Since commissioning in July 2014, IGRINS has been scheduled for more that 1000 nights on the [2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory](https://mcdonald.utexas.edu/), the [4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (now the Lowell Discovery Telescope) at Lowell Observatory](https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/), and the [8.1m Gemini South telescope](https://www.gemini.edu/).
