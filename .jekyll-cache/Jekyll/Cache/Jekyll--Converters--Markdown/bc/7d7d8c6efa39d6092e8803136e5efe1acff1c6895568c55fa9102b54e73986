<h3>IGRINS Observations</h3>
<p>Raw data from IGRINS includes the ‘SDCS’ slit-viewer images, ‘SDCH’ two-dimensional H-band echellogram, and ‘SDCK’ two-dimensional K-band echellogram.
IGRINS simultaneously observes the H and K spectra, and file numbers match for the two bands.
Slit-viewer images are generally saved during target acquisition and guiding.
An on chip image example of the IGRINS H and K band spectra can be seen below.</p>

<p>The IGRINS slit dimensions (width x length) in arcseconds are 0.34x5 at Gemini South, 0.63x9.3 at Lowell’s Discovery Telescope, and 1x15 at McDonald Observatory.
Point sources (anything with a seeing limited image on the slit-viewer) are generally observed in two positions on the slit.
The two positions, A and B, are separated by half a slit length.</p>
