<h1>IGRINS</h1>
Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph which can cover the entire wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45Î¼m in a single exposure with a resolving power of R~45,000.
IGRINS was built in a partnership between the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and the [Korea Astronomy and Space-Science Institute (KASI)](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index) with the expectation that it would be deployed to multiple facilities.
Since commissioning in July 2014, IGRINS has been scheduled for more that 1000 nights combined on the [2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory](https://mcdonald.utexas.edu/), the [4.3m Discovery Channel Telescope (now the Lowell Discovery Telescope) at Lowell Observatory](https://lowell.edu/research/telescopes-and-facilities/ldt/), and the [8.1m Gemini South telescope](https://www.gemini.edu/).
Lastly, IGRINS is a prototype for the future instrument on the [Giant Magellan Telescope](https://giantmagellan.org/), [GMTNIRS](https://www.gmt.iag.usp.br/en/projects/gmtnirs).

<h1>The Raw & Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA)</h1>
As of May 2021, IGRINS has completed almost 12,000 individual observations of both science targets and telluric standards.
RRISA features IGRINS data from more than 850 nights on-sky, resulting in 2,800 unique target observations from over 3,000 hours of total science time.
RRISA also includes IGRINS observations of over 1,200 distinct A0V standard stars.
The spatial distribution of the IGRINS observations RRISA currently encompasses are in the following image:

  <figcaption>Distribution of IGRINS observations (including A0V standards) up to May 2021 that are cross matched in SIMBAD plotted in galactic coordinates. The color gradient represents density of unique observations: areas of space where IGRINS has more unique observations are lightest, while darker teal areas have fewer unique observations. The dense region on the lower left of the plot is Taurus, the center dense region is a mix of both Ophiuchus & Upper Scorpius, and the dense region on the lower right is Orion star forming region.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Raw component of RRISA includes all of the frames IGRINS observed before May 2021--Flats, Darks, Arcs, Targets & Standards--in their unedited form.
However, we caution that the Raw component of RRISA is exactly that, unedited.
Users should not expect all target names to be searchable or coordinates to be correct (particularly for observations at McDonald Observatory).
The Reduced component of RRISA includes only the output data products from the IGRINS PipeLine Package [(IGRINS plp)](https://github.com/igrins/plp), names are tediously cross checked by hand to ensure accuracy, and coordinates are corrected when SIMBAD counterparts are available.
